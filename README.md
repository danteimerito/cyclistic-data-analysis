This project served as my capstone study for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course which I completed in September of 2023. The subject of this study is a fictitious company called Cyclistic, which owns and operates hundreds of bicycle rental stations throughout the city of Chicago, IL.

The premise of the study is that Cyclistic is trying to grow their business by developing a marketing strategy that will convert casual riders into annual members. The key distinction between annual members and casual riders is that annuals have purchased a yearly subscription to the Cyclistic service while casual riders pay on a per-ride or daily basis.

The data provided for analysis includes 1 year of bicycle trip data spanning the months of July 2022 through June 2023. Station location information was also sourced from the City of Chicago Data Portal as well as through the use of online maps.

I welcome you to read the study.

Thanks,
